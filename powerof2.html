Input: well I did not want to copy your code but rather I wanted to show I understood the concepts here. I would use text fields and have the user input the base they would like to use and the power (min and Max) and skip power
Process: Multiple the Min and Max power and use the skip power indicated 
Output: Min and Max power by skip power
